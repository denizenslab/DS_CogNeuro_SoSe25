    "# Introduction to MNE-python\n",
    "Recording from brains generates a particular kind of data. Usually this entails recording some signal at many points in time. This is called a *timeseries*. In neuroscience there are many packages specializing in questions that are of interest to us. One of the first packages that we'll use is called MNE-Python (we'll just call it MNE).\n",
    "\n",
    "MNE was first created to do one specific thing: compute something called a \"Minimum Norm Estimate\". This is a technique for determining a source of activity in the brain. However, over time people used for more and more things. Now it is a general framework for analysing electrical signals from the brain.\n",

    "In neuroscience, the most common form of data is called a *timeseries*. This essentially means that we have a sensor that collects information about some signal in the brain as it changes across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A timeseries can be anything from stock market fluctuations, to the changes in score during a basketball game, to electrical fluctuations in the brain.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Voltage on the brain surface, recorded from electrodes.\n",
    "2. A measure of blood flow on the cortex of the brain, recorded with an fMRI machine.\n",

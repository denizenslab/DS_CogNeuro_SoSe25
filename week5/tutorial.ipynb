    "# Overview\n",
    "Now that we've looked at \"average\" activity for particular events, it's time to start extracting more complicated information from our brain signals. Today's lecture is going to introduce several new topics, some of which are pretty unintuitive and/or complex. However, they're crucial to understanding the electrophysiological signals we record from the brain. Today we'll discuss a new way to think about neural signals: like a collection of oscillations. We'll cover how to filter out certain kinds of information in our neural signals. Finally, we'll combine all of these methods in order to extract a particularly useful representation of data called a **time-frequency representation**.\n",

    "## Oscillations\n",
    "Any pattern that repeats the same pattern over time we call *periodic*. This just means that this pattern oscillates over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've got an oscillation, the next question is \"how fast is it oscillating?\". At this point, we are getting close to diving into a field called \"signal processing\". This is really complicated, and beyond the scope of this class. However, we can cover some basic concepts here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define how often an oscillation occurs with its \"frequency\". This is measured in \"Hertz\" (Hz), and tells us how many times the pattern oscillates in a second. We've already covered the *sampling frequency* of a signal that we record. This is simply the number of samples we collect per second. When we talk about oscillations, the frequency means the number of *cycles* per second. For example, an oscillation with a 2Hz frequency oscillates 2 times every second. It has a \"period\" of 500 ms, the amount of time for one oscillation to occur.\n",

    "\n",
    "![alt text](../../data/images/band_pass.jpg \"band_pass\")\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if we want to split up our signal into *several* component frequencies? Moreover, we want to know the *amplitude* of the output at each frequency (as opposed to the raw filtered signal).\n",

    "To do this, we need to create a bunch of band-pass filters. We'll filter the signal at multiple frequencies and calculate the amplitude of the output. This will tell us how the frequency content of a signal *changes* in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a range of frequencies that we care about (usually from lower to higher frequencies). Then:\n",
    "* For each frequency band:\n",
    "  * Band-pass filter the signal for that frequency\n",
    "  * Calculate the **amplitude** of the output. This tells us \"how much\" of that frequency is present at each moment in time.\n",
    "* Now we have 1 output signal per frequency, representing the time-varying **amplitude** of that frequency band.\n",
    "* Stack all these signals, so that we now have data that has a shape (n_frequencies, n_times). This is called a **time-frequency representation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Time-Frequency representation is often called a **spectrogram**. There are also many ways to create a spectrogram. We'll use the same wavelet transform we used above, but this time with many frequencies."

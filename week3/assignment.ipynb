    "# Events and Eyeblinks\n",
    "This week we've seen data that is contaminated with a number of eyeblinks. These would make it very difficult to run analyses on our data (imagine if the person blinked their eyes every time we showed them a picture. We would conclude that the brain was high, but most of it would be *confounded*  with the eyeblinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use the same eyeblink detection algorithm shown in the lecture, and use it to subtract out the eyeblinks from the data. This will be an important step in data analysis because we'll start playing with event-related brain activity.\n",
